# algorithms-js

My attempt at learning JS Syntax, unit testing and developing algorithmic thinking by tackling DSA problems that even the algorithm gnomes might find chuckle-worthy!

Each folder contains the following:

- Alogorithm to the problem
- Unit test (Jest)

To run the algorithms
- Clone the repo
- ```npm -i```
- ```npm test``` 

# To-do's: 
- [x] Warm up problems (In progress)
- [x] Recursion (In progress)
- [ ] Backtracking
- [ ] Linked lists
- [ ] Stacks and Queues
- [ ] Searching and Sorting
- [ ] Dynamic Programming
- [ ] Trees and Graphs
- [ ] Dockerize the app and render the algorithm tests on local server (Optional)
