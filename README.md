# algorithms-js

My attempt at learning JS Syntax, unit testing and developing algorithmic thinking by tackling DSA problems from Leetcode and Neetcode that even the algorithm gnomes might find chuckle-worthy!

Each folder contains the following:

- Algoritm - #*LeetcodeProblemNumber* *ProblemName*.js 
- Leetcode Problem Markdown -  #*LeetcodeProblemNumber* *ProblemName*.md 

  
## In Progress's:
