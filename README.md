# algorithms-js

My attempt at learning JS Syntax and algorithmic thinking by tackling DSA problems that even the algorithm gnomes might find chuckle-worthy!

Each folder contains the following:

- Alogorithm to the problem
- Unit test (Jest)

# To-do's: 
- ~~warm-up problems~~
- Arrays and strings
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Linked lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Searching and Sorting
- Dynamic Programming
- Trees and Graphs
- Dockerize the app and render the algorithm tests on local server (Optional)
